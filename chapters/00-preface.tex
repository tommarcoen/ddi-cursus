\chapter{Preface}

This manual was written as a summary and companion guide to the course title``DNS, DHCP, en IPAM'' that I teach at Syntra Bizz.
Although I teach that course in Dutch, this companion guide is written in English and this for two reasons.
Firstly this allows me to reach a wider audience with this manual.
Secondly, it is difficult to write a technology book in Dutch, given that so many terms are in English.
I found it too difficult to decide which technical terms to translate from English to Dutch and which to keep in English.
It is impossible to translate every technical term and translating none of them -- which is really the best option so that it would be easier to search for the terms online to find more resources on them -- would make the text a real mix of Dutch and English.
I decided it is better to write the complete text in English.

I teach the accompanying course in four days of six hours each for a total of twenty four hours of in-class training.
Additionally I expect the students to make lab exercises at home.
Should you consider doing these labs in class also, the course would take about a forty hours.
