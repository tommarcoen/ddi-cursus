\chapter{VirtualBox}
\label{chap:virtualbox}

There are several hands-on labs in this course and they all require administrator access to at least a few unix machines.
Instead of using physical computers and interconnecting them using a switch, we will build a virtual lab on our computer.
There are several options available -- such as VMware Workstation and Microsoft Hyper-V -- but we will use the free VirtualBox.
This chapter briefly discusses the installation, some options, and a bit about creating virtual networks.
